# React Hooks Practice Repository
#Features Branch 
Welcome to my React Hooks Practice Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to practicing React development using functional components and hooks. The primary focus of this project is to explore and master the usage of various React hooks to build modern and efficient UI components.

## What I'm Practicing

In this repository, I'm focusing on practicing the usage of React hooks such as:

- `useState` for managing component state
- `useEffect` for handling side effects and lifecycle methods
- `useContext` for managing global state
- `useReducer` for more complex state management
- `useMemo` for optimizing performance
- `useCallback` for optimizing function references
- `custom hooks` for reusing logic across components/

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-hooks-practice.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-hooks-practice`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with hooks, and build your own components to practice using React hooks effectively.
